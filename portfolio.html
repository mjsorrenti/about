      <p>On this page I've tried to provide some examples of my UX design work. Much of my career has been at an enterprise software company, which unfortunately makes it difficult to openly share what I have done; many of the projects I work on are strategic in nature, and there is often a gap of up to multiple years between the initial designs and the release of a product to the public. Of course if you would like to discuss my work in more detail and in the appropriate context, please feel free to <a href="mailto:mjsorrenti@gmail.com">contact me</a>.</p>

      <h2>Multiscale Experiment Creation</h2>
      
      <article>
          <p>This was a  long-term project where I was tasked with designing from scratch a web application to assemble and manage simulation models from varying domains, applications, and users. We adopted a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_systems_engineering" target="_blank">model-based systems engineering (MBSE)</a> approach to establish to establish a coherent visual language for manipulating these models and their interactions. Below are images of some key deliverables in building up the vision and implementation for this product.</p>

          <p>This product was released as the Multiscale Experiment Creation app under the <a href="https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/disciplines/multiphysics-modeling-simulation/tag/3672-10361/" target="_blank">Multiscale Systems Specialist role</a>. Here's a nifty video that the Marketing department put together to publicize the role.</p>

    <h2>Web Design</h2>
      
      <article>
          <p>This site is obviously an example of my web experience, since I designed and implemented it myself.</p>
          <p>Another good example is the work I did redesigning and implementing a new site for Brown Play School, a preschool in Rumford, Rhode Island. My goals with this project included improving the information architecture of the previous site, implementing responsive behavior for multi-device support, and updating the visual design. I used <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and customized the <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/make/" target="_blank">"Make" theme from The Theme Foundry</a>.</p>
          <p>Check out a snapshot of the previous site compared to the current site.</p>
