      <p>On this page I've tried to provide some examples of my UX design work. Much of my career has been at an enterprise software company, which unfortunately makes it difficult to openly share what I have done; many of the projects I work on are strategic in nature, and there is often a gap of multiple years between the initial designs and the release of a product to the public. Of course if you would like to discuss my work in more detail and in the appropriate context, please feel free to <a href="mailto:mjsorrenti@gmail.com">contact me</a>.</p>

      <h2>Multiscale Experiment Creation</h2>
      
      <article>
          <p>This was a  long-term project where I was tasked with designing a brand new web application to assemble and manage simulation models from varying domains, applications, and users. I adopted a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_systems_engineering" target="_blank">model-based systems engineering (MBSE)</a> approach to establish a coherent visual language for working with these models and their interactions. Below are images of some key deliverables in building up the vision and implementation for this product.</p>

          <p>This product was released as the Multiscale Experiment Creation app under the <a href="https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/disciplines/multiphysics-modeling-simulation/tag/3672-10361/" target="_blank">Multiscale Systems Specialist role</a>. Here's a nifty video that the Marketing department put together to publicize the role.</p>

    <h2>Web Design</h2>
      
      <article>
          <p>This site is one example of my web experience, since I <a href="index.html#aboutthissite">designed and implemented it myself</a>.</p>
          <p>Another good example is work I did redesigning and implementing a site for Brown Play School, a preschool in Rumford, Rhode Island. My goals with this project included improving the information architecture of the previous site, implementing responsive behavior for multi-device support, and updating the visual design. I used <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> and created a customization of the <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/make/" target="_blank">"Make" theme from The Theme Foundry</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Check out a snapshot of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171211215358/http://brownplayschool.org/" target="_blank">previous site</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.brownplayschool.org" target="_blank">current site</a>.</p>
          
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171211215358/http://brownplayschool.org/" target="_blank"><img src="images/bps-site-old.png"></a>
          
          <a href="https://www.brownplayschool.org" target="_blank"><img src="images/bps-site-new.png"></a>
          
          <p>I also used the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com" target="_blank">Django framework</a> to create a web app enabling electronic bidding and payment at the school's silent auction fundraiser. There's not a lot to see (since we wiped the database and you probably don't have a login), but feel free to <a href="https://bpsfallfete.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">take a look</a> if you're curious.</p>

     <h2>Visibility Controls for 3D Models</h2>
      
      <article>
          <p>This was an interactive prototype I created to explore UI paradigmms for navigating complex 3-dimensional CAD models. The goal was to quickly hide or show components of the product to focus in on areas of interest.</p>
          
          <a id="visibility-link" href="visibility/VisibilityControlsISDtouch.html" target="_blank">Try It!</a>
          
          <img src="images/visibility-screenshot.png">
          
          <p class="disclaimer">There's some bad news: I did this prototype in Flash and ActionScript. At the time it was the right tool for the job, but these days it means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#End_of_life" target="_blank">it won't run on certain devices</a>. I was also targeting a specific hardware configuration, so you'll need a mouse with a scroll wheel to experience everything. At some point I may port this to an HTML5 implementation, but for now my apologies if it doesn't work for you.</p>
          
          <table>
              <tr><td><img src="images/Move.png"></td> <td>To pan the model, hold the <kbd>[Shift]</kbd> key while dragging with the left mouse button.</td></tr>
              <tr><td><img src="images/ZoomInOut_32x.png"></td> <td>To zoom the model, use the mouse wheel.</td></tr>
              <tr><td><img src="images/Keep_Icon.png"></td> <td>Click directly on a component to either hide it or hide all <em>other</em> components.</td></tr>
              <tr><td><img src="images/Model_Visibility_Icon.png"></td> <td>This icon shows the Visibility Manager dialog.</td></tr>
              <tr><td><img src="images/Gesture_Icon.png"></td> <td>This icon toggles "Quick Select" mode. While the mode is active, draw a circle around a region of the model to select it; click <em>inside</em> the circle to hide all <em>unselected</em> components, or click <em>outside</em> the circle to hide all <em>selected</em> components.</td></tr>
              <tr><td><img src="images/View_Manip_Mode_Icon.png"></td> <td>This icon toggles "View Manipulation" mode. While the mode is active, any components that do not fit fully on the screen are dynamically hidden as you pan and zoom the model.</td></tr>
              <tr><td><img src="images/Visibility_Filter_Icon.png"></td> <td>This icon opens the Visibility Filter panel.</td></tr>
              <tr><td><img src="images/Reset_Icon.png"></td> <td>This icon resets the model to its original visibility state.</td></tr>
